## Overview
This is my personal portfolio site designed to showcase who I am, my skills, and the projects I've built over time. It reflects my personality while keeping everything clean and professional.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript were used to build a fast-loading, mobile-friendly, responsive portfolio without relying on heavy frameworks.

## Design Philosophy
The design follows a dark theme with clean typography and project filtering. I focused on making sure visitors can navigate quickly and understand my background within seconds.

## What I Learned
This project taught me how to think like a designer and make responsive layouts. It was also the foundation for organizing my web projects better moving forward.
